    <p>
    I participate in the girls who code summer immersion program where we learn python, robotics, web development, and date science. I live in Cupertino with my mom and dad; my brother attends UCLA Dental School. I am a rising senior and I am excited to begin the college application process. When I’m not studying at Philz, you can find me tutoring kids, playing soccer, writing articles, or hanging out with my friends. My family and I travel a lot and I love spending time with them so it will be hard to leave them when I go off to college.

    <p>
    Coding Arduino robots to detect obstacles around them
    </p>
    <p>
    In this project we used the Arduino C language to code the robot’s movement when it detected an object using its whisker sensors. We also worked on the hardware on this project, and attached three pins that detected when the whisker sensors pushed back. Once this detection was caught our robot was coded to go back for 3 seconds and them turn away from the object. We also added a red light feature, so as soon as the robot senses something in its way the user will be able to see the red light go off
